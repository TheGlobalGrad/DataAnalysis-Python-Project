# DataAnalysis_Python_Project

# 📊 Data Analytics with Python (Mock Practice Project)

This repository contains my **first practice project using Python + Data Analysis**, created for **hands-on learning**. This was a **mock project** to get comfortable with **pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook** workflows.

⚠️ **Note:** This project may not yield deep or actionable insights as it was purely for practice and learning how to handle, analyze, and visualize data systematically.


## 🚀 Project Overview

- Load and explore **student exam score data**.
- Perform **basic data cleaning and preprocessing**.
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**:
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Visualizations (histograms, bar plots, heatmaps)
- Use **groupby** to learn how to analyze categorical variables.
- Practice **data visualization** to understand patterns visually.
- Learn workflow for **data analytics projects in Python**.
